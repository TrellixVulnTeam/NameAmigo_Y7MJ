Twitter – Having rejected the name Twitch for their social networking service, 
co-founder Jack Dorsey says: "we looked in the dictionary for words around it 
and we came across the word 'twitter' and it was just perfect. 
The definition was 'a short burst of inconsequential information', 
and 'chirps from birds'. And that's exactly what the product was."[107]
